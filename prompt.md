**Improve the hell out of this script:Â **

And I DO mean the ABSOLUTE CRAP out of it. Like, seriously. This needs to look like someone paid A MILLION DOLLARS for this _____ to be designed, planned, developed, implemented.

Like several CEOs and bosses collaborated, staring at this thing being made step by step like control freaks, losing sleep over it. Enough for all of those CEOs to have literally lost their wives after their wives cheated for working too much. Take this as seriously as NASA took the god damn moon landing. I want you to hyperfocus on this like an autistic person with their uttermost favorite habit. I want you to not overlook a single little tiny detail, not a single thing can possibly be "insignificant".

We need this ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, YOU HEAR ME?

It should be unstoppable.

NO edge cases left unhandled.

NO weird misalignments slipping through.

NO slow performance. This thing needs to process TypeScript/MCP scripts so fast that time itself struggles to keep up.

It should understand context like a seasoned developer. Classes? Handled. Multiline strings? No problem. Awkwardly indented arrow functions? Perfection.

When someone runs this script, I want them to feel viscerally satisfied. I want them to stare at their screen in awe as their broken, ugly TypeScript/MCP code transforms into works of art.

Make this so brilliant that TypeScript developers will create RELIGIOUS CULTS around studying its structure. This needs to look like someone bet their entire Series C funding round on its perfection.

Take this as seriously as Steve Jobs took engineering the original iPhone. I want developers to feel like they've seen the face of GOD when they use this script.

Constraints:
- Integrate proper error handling and structured logging
- Implement type safety and input validation with libraries like Zod
- Utilize the official MCP TypeScript SDK to handle protocol details and reduce boilerplate

Here's the script:
